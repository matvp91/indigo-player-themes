# indigo-player-themes

A collection of themes for indigo-player. Feel free to submit a pull request with your own theme if you'd like to share!

## Getting started

The easiest way is to clone and checkout the indigo-player [GitHub repository](https://github.com/matvp91/indigo-player) and start theming the default UI by modifying the SASS files in `src/ui/theme`. You can spawn a webserver with hot reloading with `yarn dev` and once finished, run `yarn build`. In the `lib` folder, your theme will be there as `indigo-theme.css`. All that's left to do is rename your theme in the proper format `indigo-theme-<name>.css` and that's it!

Starting from the default theme gives you a very strong basis and is highly recommended.
